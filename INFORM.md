This Python script defines a function named `parseData()` that reads a Windows batch script file and cleans it up by resolving environment variables and removing special characters used for line continuation. The cleaned script is then saved to a new file with `_cleaned` appended to the original file name.

The script starts by importing the `os`, `re`, and `sys` modules, and defining a list of valid file extensions as `EXTENSIONS`. It also creates two empty global variables `envData` and `collectedLines`.

The `hasData()` function checks if a given key (in lowercase) exists in the `envData` dictionary.

The `appendData()` function adds a new key-value pair to the `envData` dictionary, but only if the key does not already exist (case-insensitive).

The `trimCarat()` function removes the carat (^) character and the following character from a string, which is a special character used for line continuation in Windows batch scripts.

The `parseData()` function first loops through all the lines in `collectedLines`. For each line, it replaces any environment variables of the form `%VARNAME:~start,length%` with the corresponding value from `envData`, where `VARNAME` is the name of the environment variable, `start` is the starting index of the substring to extract, and `length` is the length of the substring to extract. If the environment variable does not exist in `envData` or the substring is out of bounds, the variable is replaced with an empty string.

If the deobfuscated line starts with the `set` keyword, the function extracts the key-value pair from the line and adds it to `envData`, but only if the key does not already exist (case-insensitive). The original line is then replaced with the deobfuscated line.

The main block of the script reads the name of the input file from the command-line arguments, checks that the file exists and has a valid extension, and then reads each line from the file into `collectedLines`. The `parseData()` function is called to clean up the script, and then the cleaned script is written to a new file with `_cleaned` appended to the original file name. If any errors occur, they are caught and printed to the console.
